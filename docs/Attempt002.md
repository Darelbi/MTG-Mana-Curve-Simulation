The second optimization really makes sense, now basically I must check if I can
improve with other kind of cards like Fling, Atog, Great Furnace, Silverbluff 
Bridge, Mountain, Paradise Mantle, Welding Jar.

Also I should check a simulation where creatures with attack 3 or less do not 
attack since 4/4 creatures are very common nowadays.
