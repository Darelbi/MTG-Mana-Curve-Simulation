Once found the optimal deck we want to swap out some cards and add cards from
the sideboard.

 - 4    x Ornithopter
 - 4    x Memnite
 - 1    x Thought Monitor
 - 4    x Master of Etherium

Total: 60 Total Cards

There are the cards that should be removed (in THIS order) to get the minimal
impact on the game. I limited to 10 cards, but I think you should swap less cards
